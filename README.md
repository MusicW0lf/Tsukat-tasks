## Brief Conclusion
Algorithm have quadratic-like scale, but if we take word size as a constant we will get nice linear scale.
## Time Complexity
If we consider m — words amount and n — word size as two independent variables we will get complexity of O(n*m), if word size is a constant we get linear O(m). This is visible in a plot below:
